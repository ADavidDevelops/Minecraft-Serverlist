# Minecraft-Serverlist - A New Design for a new audiance
I'm excited to announce I have created a brand new server list, This is a fully custom theme (well kind of, More on this later) I have easily put more than 12 hours into this and it's turning out AMAZING, We look nothing like any other server list out there, in fact, compared to ours they might as well be called banner lists, Here are some sneak peaks and explanations, (Redesigned thread by request)
