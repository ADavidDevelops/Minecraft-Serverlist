# Minecraft-Serverlist
I'm excited to announce I have created a brand new server list, This is a fully custom theme (well kind of, More on this later) I have easily put more than 12 hours into this and it's turning out AMAZING, We look nothing like any other server list out there, in fact, compared to ours they might as well be called banner lists, Here are some sneak peaks and explanations, (Redesigned thread by request)
Home Page >>
We now bring you a sleek and modern looking homepage, Servers will be laid out in a grid depending on screen size (Even if you're on a phone or extra large screen), All servers will have a 256x256 icon to fill (needs to be around that size others may work too under testing as of the moment), under every icon you will see a live player count from the last ping (Every 5 minutes) and on the top right corner you will see the amount no shares the server has gotten, Clicking on any aspect of the server will bring you to there page

Server Page >>
We also bring you an amazing server page to fit our modern design we have created a new looking server page, featuring category, author, date posted, shares, and much more useful information like user description, name, and even a large banner for the background

Creation Page >>
Our server creation page may look the same as our server page but its perfect that way! you will be able to live edit the servers information including description, banner, server name, and more! this allows you to make sure everything looks right and is formatted correctly the first time without many unnecessary edits, this also works perfectly to sizing your banner to fit in the frame perfectly

Featured List >>
<WIP Unrealised>
Misc >>
Our epic navbar looks amazing and works great for us and we hope you to, Quickly change catalogs or search for a server you want the ip of,

[Unusable] -- Most if not all features are not complete and won't function properly
[Risky] -- Most if not all features are made but not complete and may fail sometimes
[Usable] -- All features are complete and working with very little/no fails
[Complete] -- Server list is officially usable all features are complete with no bugs/fails
Current Stage : [Unusable] (Almost in Risky)

Like the idea? Think I should make it? Consider donating to me to help support me in doing so! (DM me for Paypal <3)
(If this seems familiar, an old member (8 months now) created a page semi like this but closed it and never completed, I decided I was going to take some of the design, while this is a cheesy thing to do it was an amazing website and id love to honor it, also I had to recode it all due to no public source ;-; )
